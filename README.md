# Qnect

Qnect is a full-stack web application built using Django for the backend and ReactJS for the frontend. It is developed as a learning project to explore Django and React and their integration for building modern web applications. Qnect enables users to generate QR codes based on information provided by them.

**Please Note:** Qnect is developed as my personal learning project, and while efforts have been made to ensure its functionality, it may contain incomplete features or suboptimal implementations as the development of this web application is still ongoing.

## Technologies Used
- Backend:
  - Django: A high-level Python web framework for building web applications.
  - Django REST Framework: A powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs in Django.
- Frontend:
  - ReactJS: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Roadmap
- Enhance user interface and experience.
- Implement additional features such as customization options, qr vaults, etc.
- Add unit tests and integration tests for improved code quality and reliability.

## Acknowledgements
Special thanks to the creators and maintainers of Django, ReactJS, and other open-source libraries used in this project for their invaluable contributions to the development community.
